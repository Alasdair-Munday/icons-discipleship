      “Don’t fill yourself up with wine. Getting drunk will lead to wild living.
      Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit. Speak to one another with psalms,
      hymns and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to
      the Lord.”
  - reference: "Acts 2:1-4 "
    text: When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
      Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and
      filled the whole house where they were sitting. They saw what seemed to be
      tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of
      them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues
      as the Spirit enabled them.
  - reference: "Jeremiah 20.9 "
    text: “there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I
      am weary with holding it in, and I cannot.”
  - reference: Gal 5:22-25
    text: the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
      faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no
      law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its
      passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step
      with the Spirit.
  - reference: Exodus 13.21
    text: “…and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might

      For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is
      in you through the laying on of my hands.
questions:
  - question: The scriptures teach us that we are to keep on being filled with the
      Holy Spirit (Ephesians 5.18) - are you regularly asking for the Holy
      Spirit to fill you? Why not ask now? And remember to give Him time and
      space - don’t rush!
  - question: Is there an area of your life where you need to ask for the Holy
      Spirit to help you? Do you need healing?
  - question: Learning to listen for the guidance of the Spirit and obediently
      following takes practice - how are you learning to listen and follow? You
      may want to ask someone else to join you in learning to listen and follow
      His prompts.
  - question: Are you creating space for silence and solitude in which to hear the
      Lord? Are their other habits/practices/spiritual disciplines you could
      take up to help you be more sensitive to His presence in your life?
  - question: Is there an area of your life where you know that you are being
      disobedient or you feel defeated? Down through the years Christians have
      often practiced a daily ‘examen’ where they invite the Holy Spirit to
      reflect upon the day with them and show them what they need to address.
      (you will find an example of an examen in the worksheets at the end of
      this booklet)
  - question: "Are you growing in holiness - does your character look more and more
      like Jesus? "
  - question: Is there anything that you need to confess and seek God’s forgiveness over?
  - question: Are you aware of the spiritual gifts that the Holy Spirit has given
      you - and are there new gifts you would like? How could you make use of
      this gift in your local Church or Connect group?
  - question: The Holy Spirit helps us to pray and intercede for others - how are
      you regularly praying and interceding?
  - question: The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
      goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control - which of these fruit
      do you need more of?
  - question: "  Being filled with the Holy Spirit means that we surrender ourselves
      into God’s hand and leading - is fear and anxiety holding you back? Are
      you trying to grasp or control things?"
  - question: How are you going to practice the fire?

**Disciples of Jesus live life in the company of the Holy Spirit - God living within us -  learning how to listen, follow and be shaped by Him.**

One evening Blaise Pascal, the great French philosopher, had an encounter with God so powerful that he wrote it down and sewed into his jacket to be carried wherever he went. One word stands out from his meeting with God:

Fire!

As followers of Jesus we receive the Holy Spirit. He is like a fire who warms our hearts and illuminates all parts of our lives - He is the burning presence of God within us.

Experiencing the work of the Spirit is wonderful. He is a constant reminder of whose we are - because too often we forget. He is a refiner whose work is to mould and shape us to be more like Jesus and to do what Jesus did. He is our guiding light - the Counsellor who aids us on our way.

We can’t be disciples under our own steam, we need the power of the Holy Spirit and discipleship is about  ‘keeping on being filled’.

But the Holy Spirit equips us in other ways. He gives to each of us gifts that we ‘fan into flame’ as we use them for the Kingdom. It is through the Spirit that we find a different quality of life, filled with the fruits He causes to grow in us. 

Following Jesus is life ‘in the Spirit’ - life ‘under the influence’ of God.

**Discipleship is about the fire.**
