description: It is at the cross that our journey of discipleship must begin, and
  it is to the cross that we must continually return.
passages:
  - reference: Romans 5:8
    text: "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still
      sinners, Christ died for us."
  - reference: Luke 9:23
    text: "Then he said to them all: ‘Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny
      themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me."
  - text: The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found
      it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and
      bought that field.
    reference: Matt 13.44
  - reference: Phil 3.7-12
    text: But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.
      What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth
      of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I
      consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not
      having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which
      is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the
      basis of faith. I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his
      resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his
      death, and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead. Not
      that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal,
      but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of
      me.
  - reference: 1 Peter 2.24
    text: He himself bore our sins, in his body on the cross, so that we might die
      to sins and live for righteousness
  - reference: Col 3:17
    text: And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the
      Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
  - reference: Revelation 5.12
    text: Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom
      and might and honour and glory and blessing!

Jesus is the heart of discipleship. 

 He is our Saviour, Teacher, Healer and more. 

 Jesus is Lord.

 And He extends an invitation to all of us to come to Him and live in His Kingdom.

 When we look on the cross we are reminded of all the wonderful works of Jesus but above all else it speaks to us of HIs death and resurrection - the greatest events in history.

 And so it is at the cross that our journey of discipleship must begin, and it is to the cross that we must continually return. We see the cross as an end and a beginning. 

 It is the end of sin for us - its power is broken. 

 The end of shame - it is washed away. 

 It is death’s end - our death Jesus died. 

 And it is the end of Satan’s rule - he has no right to control us. 

 But it’s also a beginning. It is the doorway to resurrection, the ascension and the launch of His Heaven on earth agenda.

 The cross speaks, once and for all, of God’s love, victory and commitment to His world. But the cross also speaks of us.

 To follow Christ is the death of our old life and the beginning of something completely new. In Christ we are given a life that is truly worth living, but also a Kingdom that is worth giving our lives for. 

 We are invited to let go of all we cling to and take hold of the new Kingdom life that is gifted to us. 

 It is a life of love, a life of freedom but also a life of obedience and transformation.

 It is a life lived in response to God’s call. 

 The cross reminds us of the costly way in which God has loved the world and the cost of discipleship.

 **Discipleship is about the cross.**
