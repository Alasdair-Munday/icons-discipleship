    <p> <span class="scribble">DISCIPLESHIP</span> can be explained and explored in a number of ways. It lies at the heart of what it means to be a Christian and Church.
    Life for the follower of Jesus is about being and making disciples.
    Here are 5 symbols that we believe open us up to a lifetime of exploring, discussing, learning and following.
</p>
<br/>
  <p>
    These 5 images help us understand the core elements of discipleship for our own journey and for those we are walking with. They work on a number of levels - regardless of age, experience, culture or knowledge.
    Whilst these symbols carry firm and important meanings for us they also invite the imagination and learning of all of us. In this booklet you will find our understanding of these images but they invite you to think - what does this image mean for you and your discipleship?
    They are doorways into whole landscapes of wonderful Kingdom riches.
    We hope and pray that through these symbols Jesus will speak, lead and shape us to be the people He dreams we can become.
