    text: >+
      “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. He cuts off every
      branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit
      he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful…Remain in me, as I also
      remain in you…If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever
      you wish, and it will be done for you.”

      “Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you.”
    reference: "Romans 12.3 "
  - text: “Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and
      petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.”
    reference: "Philippians 4.6 "
  - text: “But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your
      Father, who is unseen.”
    reference: "Matthew 6.6 "
  - text: ‘Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labour
      and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your
      God…For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and
      all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord
      blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
    reference: "Exodus 20:8-11 "
questions:
  - question: When you reflect upon your life at the moment are you living within a
      healthy rhythm of work, rest and play?
  - question: Are you caring for yourself physically, emotionally, spiritually and
      relationally (eating, sleeping, exercise etc)?
  - question: Does prayer, regular retreating from the busyness of life and scripture
      reading hold an important enough place in your day to day life? How and when
      do you create space to pray? How and when do you sit down to read the Bible?
  - question: What was the last thing that God spoke to you through the Bible?
  - question: Do you regularly have a sabbath - a day of rest and more time abiding in
      God’s love?
  - question: As the vine invites us to let God cut from our lives much of the clutter -
      is there a way in which you could simplify your life?
  - question: One of the many habits that Jesus assumes we will practice is fasting -
      creating space in our lives for feasting on God - do you regularly fast?
  - question: Are you too busy - is time a blessing or a curse?
  - question: Is there anything at the moment that is preventing you from living closely
      and intimately with God?
  - question: "Down through the years Christian’s have often responded to the presence of
      God in their lives by creating a ‘rule of life’ - which is simply a pattern
      of practices and commitments that help us abide. Do you have a rhythm,
      pattern or rule for your life? "
  - question: How are you going to practice the vine?

Here we have one of the  most powerful images that Jesus left us with.

 Jesus is the vine. 

 Our Father in Heaven the gardener.

 We are the branches. 

 The vine  is about our connection with God and the life-changing teaching of Jesus that we are to marinade in and live out. 

 It is a call to a fruitful life that is marked by obedience to God’s word - the Bible.

 The vine symbolises important Kingdom rhythms of rest, growth and pruning. We are called to cultivate Jesus shaped patterns for living.

 The vine speaks to us about the activity of God in our lives - as a branch from the vine we need to detach from things which keep us from God (even good things that perhaps need a rest) and we engage with what feeds us, restores us and reminds us who we are.

 But the vine reminds us of the ebb and flow of life itself - the many seasons that we will walk through. It promises us God’s life giving presence throughout -  especially in times of suffering.

 **Discipleship is about the vine.**

 But what do you see as you look at this image? 

 As you talk with Jesus what is He teaching you? 

 Are there particular Bible verses that you find helpful in the light of this image, or is there a part of the scriptures that further illuminates this icon?
