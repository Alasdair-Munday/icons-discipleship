The Kingdom of God is like a seed - small, seemingly insignificant, yet growing.

 Much of this growth happens unseen, in secret, but we can be assured that God’s Kingdom is unstoppable.

 So the seeds speak to us about the way God is at work in the world, and an invitation to be part of it. 

 God is the sower - implanting His word in and around us. We need to make sure we are the type of soil that allows those seeds to grow.

 But we are also partners - fellow missionaries and sowers with God. Joining Him in that wonderfully organic process of giving away what He has given us and watching things grow or not! Then giving again… and again… and again.

 Generous sowers

 The seeds speak of the 5 marks of mission:

* To proclaim the Good News of the Kingdom
* To teach, baptise and nurture believers
* To respond to human need by loving service
* To transform unjust structures of society, to challenge violence of every kind and pursue peace and reconciliation
* To strive to safeguard the integrity of creation, and sustain and renew the life of the earth

But  seeds also remind us that we are in a spiritual battle. Satan and his forces are at work stealing, spoiling and destroying wherever possible. As disciples we need to stay awake to the realities of this battle - we need to live life remembering that we are at war.

 **Discipleship is about the seeds.**
