Jesus is the heart of discipleship. 

He is our Saviour, Teacher, Healer and more. 

Jesus is Lord.

And He extends an invitation to all of us to come to Him and live in His Kingdom.

When we look on the cross we are reminded of all the wonderful works of Jesus but above all else it speaks to us of HIs death and resurrection - the greatest events in history.

And so it is at the cross that our journey of discipleship must begin, and it is to the cross that we must continually return. We see the cross as an end and a beginning. 

It is the end of sin for us - its power is broken. 

The end of shame - it is washed away. 

It is death’s end - our death Jesus died. 

And it is the end of Satan’s rule - he has no right to control us. 

But it’s also a beginning. It is the doorway to resurrection, the ascension and the launch of His Heaven on earth agenda.

The cross speaks, once and for all, of God’s love, victory and commitment to His world. But the cross also speaks of us.

To follow Christ is the death of our old life and the beginning of something completely new. In Christ we are given a life that is truly worth living, but also a Kingdom that is worth giving our lives for. 

We are invited to let go of all we cling to and take hold of the new Kingdom life that is gifted to us. 

It is a life of love, a life of freedom but also a life of obedience and transformation.

It is a life lived in response to God’s call. 

The cross reminds us of the costly way in which God has loved the world and the cost of discipleship.

Discipleship is about the cross.

But what do you see as you look at this image? 

As you talk with Jesus what is He teaching you? 

Are there particular Bible verses that you find helpful in the light of this image, or is there a part of the scriptures that further illuminates this icon?

## Here are some Bible Passages that we believe lie at the heart of what this icon is all about:

**Romans 5.8** 
> “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

**Luke 9:23** 
> Then he said to them all: ‘Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.

**Matt 13.44**
> ‘The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.

**Phil 3.7-12**
> But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith. I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead.
> Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.

**1 Peter 2.24** 
> “He himself bore our sins, in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness”

**Col 3:17** 
> And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.

**Revelation 5.12**
> “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honour and glory and blessing!

## Practices and Questions: How can we live in the light of the cross?

It is important that these Icons don’t just invite us to reflect but that they move us into action. Below you will find some practices to be explored on your own or in groups and some questions that you and others may wish to reflect upon:

The cross is at the heart of all that Jesus is about - but do you know and have you read any of the accounts of His life? Are you familiar with the details of his life, teaching, healings, death, resurrection and ascension? Why not commit to read one of the Gospel accounts - a chapter a day - for the next few weeks?

The Cross invites a response of faith, trust and allegiance to Jesus as our King - have you made a decision to commit your life to Christ?  If there are any questions that might prevent you from taking this step of faith why not speak to someone who could help.

It may be that now is the right time for you to mark your faith publicly by being baptised? Before you enter the water you will be sealed with the sign of the cross!

The Cross invites us to respond in awe, wonder and worship - how is your life punctuated like this? Are you living a life of gratitude and praise?

Following Jesus is a life of daily repentance - what do you need to give up to follow Jesus? What do you need to take hold of - maybe a promise of His - today?

We live in a world that is constantly shaping us - you could perhaps say the world is discipling us - what is shaping you? What often takes the place of Jesus in your life?

The Cross reminds us that each day is to be marked by daily surrender and the entrusting of our lives into His love scarred hands - what do you need to trust Jesus with today?

As you gaze upon the cross it’s important to ask - do you know that you are deeply and truly loved by God? Is there anything getting in the way of that?

What is God’s call on your life - do you have a particular vocation that the Lord is inviting you to explore?

What defines you? For the disciple of Christ our identity is shaped by the cross - “for me to live is Christ, to die is gain”. 

How are you going to practice the cross?
