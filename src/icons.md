  These 5 images help us understand the core elements of discipleship for our
  own journey and for those we are walking with. They work on a number of levels
  - regardless of age, experience, culture or knowledge. Whilst these symbols
  carry firm and important meanings for us they also invite the imagination and
  learning of all of us. In this booklet you will find our understanding of
  these images but they invite you to think:


  **What does this image mean for you and your discipleship?**


  We hope and pray that through these symbols Jesus will speak, lead and shape us to be the people He dreams we can become.

Icons are works of art created to be windows through which we see.
Down through the years they have been used as physical representations of the Gospel, a resource for teaching Kingdom truths, even a means of grace.
They leave space for our imagination whilst pulling us back to what really matters.
Ultimately they are a tool by which we connect and learn to walk in the company of Jesus.
Here are 5 modern day icons that we believe open us up to a lifetime of exploring, discussing, learning and following.
