Jesus was regularly found ‘at table’ with His friends. Eating and drinking, listening and loving sinners.

 The table is a powerful symbol of welcome. It is a place of forgiveness and feasting, but it’s also a place of remembrance when we gather around the Communion table.

 It is a space for family - sisters, brothers and friends. The Church is called to be a  generous, life-enhancing community.

 Tables are not just for people we know well or even like, but they are places where we welcome strangers and those we find difficult  as a demonstration of the way God welcomed us into His family.

 Tables are places where arguments are worked through, important conversations are had and where laughter and tears flow.

 They are places of learning - from God and from one another and it is often round a table we grow in self-awareness and where our characters are shaped - as iron sharpens iron. 

 The table reminds us that we are encouraged to keep meeting… keep loving… keep praying… keep serving one another regardless of the circumstances.

 **Discipleship is about the table.**
