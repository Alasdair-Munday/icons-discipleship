These five icons hold together the vast landscape of discipleship - and all five are needed for a balanced and healthy faith - but what next? Ultimately the vision is that these icons would be so displayed in our lives that we wouldn’t really need to draw them any longer!

It is essential that we find ways of practicing these icons together so that we can unlock the Kingdom life God is wanting to birth in and through us.

It may be that the next step is to make use of other great resources:

For those wanting to explore more about who Jesus is why not come on our next Alpha course.

So much of our lives is shaped by pain and past experiences. We often get trapped in habits that are very controlling. We run the Keys to Freedom course and that could be the right next step for you.

As we’ve already stated discipleship is best done around the table. We would encourage everyone to be part of a small group or Connect group - a team of people who gather together to deliberately explore these five icons and journey as disciples together. Below you will find, in the worksheets section, a simple suggestion for how to gather together and begin to put these icons into practice.

But alongside all of this we want to suggest another way in which we can pick up these icons and make use of them.\
The ancient practice of a rule of life:

**A Rule of life**

A rule of life is a way of organising how we live - call it a training program - around a set of practices and rhythms that help us carve out space within, alongside and around our busy lives so that we can enjoy the company of Jesus, be shaped to be more like Him and find ourselves partnering with Him in the world. A rule of life is about the practice of spiritual disciplines but also is about the using of everyday moments as moments of connection with God.

A rule of life answers five simple questions:

Where is the Cross in your life?
Where is the Fire in your life?
Where is the Table in your life?
Where are the Seeds in your life?
Where is the Vine in your life?

After each icon, often within the questions, we referenced a series of practices. These practices don’t just apply to one of the icons but often span some or all of them. For example, (add comma) Bible study roots us deeply into all five; (add semicolon) hospitality is both an expression of the table and the seeds. 

This is not a complete list, but more than enough to get us started:

Silence
Solitude
Exercise
Bible study
Prayer
Simplicity
Fellowship
Hospitality
Surrender
Confession
Fasting
Sabbath
Celebration
Praise
Evangelism
Caring for creation (alongside the other Five Marks of Mission) (not sure why this is needed)
Examen

A rule of life takes these practices and builds them into our lives - starting small, always relying on the Holy Spirit and walking patiently.
