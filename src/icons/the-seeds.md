    text: |
      The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me,
          because the Lord has anointed me
          to proclaim good news to the poor.
      He has sent me to bind up the broken-hearted,
          to proclaim freedom for the captives
          and release from darkness for the prisoners,
      to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour
  - reference: Mark 4:30-32
    text: Again he said, ‘What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what
      parable shall we use to describe it? It is like a mustard seed, which is
      the smallest of all seeds on earth. Yet when planted, it grows and becomes
      the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds
      can perch in its shade.’
  - reference: "Luke 10.5 "
    text: “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ If someone who
      promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will
      return to you.”
  - reference: Matt 28.19
    text: >
      “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the
      name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching
      them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you
      always, to the very end of the age.”
  - reference: Galatians 6.7-10
    text: >
      Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap
      a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us
      do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of
      believers.
questions:
  - question: As you reflect upon the seeds - what is God sowing in your life at the
      moment and are you letting it bear fruit?
    practice: ""
  - question: Everyday is a new day with a pocket load of seeds! Why not ask every
      morning - Who is God leading me to so that I can share God’s love (Luke
      10:6)?
  - question: Are there people of peace - people who are warm towards you - who God
      has been working within in readiness to hear His good news?
  - question: When you listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit are there particular
      tasks or things that need to be shared with people around you?
  - question: God cares deeply for the whole of His creation - the marks of mission
      are a helpful reminder of the scope of His Kingdom and concern - which of
      the 5 do you most need to practice at the moment? Is there an opportunity
      to respond to one of the 5 now?
  - question: These marks of mission point out to us the impact that we often have
      on the world around us - over consuming and abusing creation. It may be
      that simplifying our lives would be a good response to this?
  - question: When you watch the news - is there a need or an issue that the Lord is
      asking you to commit to intercede for?
  - question: When you look at the resources that you have available to you - are
      you living generously? Are you blessing the poor?
  - question: When it comes to living as a missionary - do you have the courage and
      hope that you need - or do you need to pray for more?
  - question: Where is God calling you? Does the Lord have a particular people group
      or place that he is wanting you to go and live in?
  - question: How are you going to practice the seeds?

**The Seeds: Missional Action**

**Jesus declared - the Kingdom of God is at hand. He is making all things new and so we join in - loving, serving, sharing, giving etc.**

The Kingdom of God is like a seed - small, seemingly insignificant, yet it is God’s rule and reign growing. Much of this growth happens unseen, in secret, but we can be assured that God’s Kingdom is unstoppable. 

God is the sower - scattering Kingdom truth in, around and through us. As disciples our task is give that seed space to grow - be good soil -  and to nurture that seed around us.

But in other ways we are the sower - joining  in with what our Father in Heaven is up to. His business is the resurrection business, and we are invited to invest with our whole lives.

To grasp the scale of this generous Kingdom it can be helpful to refer to the 5 marks of mission that invite our participation:

* To proclaim the Good News of the Kingdom
* To teach, baptise and nurture believers
* To respond to human need by loving service
* To transform unjust structures of society, to challenge violence of every kind and pursue peace and reconciliation
* To strive to safeguard the integrity of creation, and sustain and renew the life of the earth

But we also need to be wise. In the parable of the sower some of the seeds that are scattered are snatched away - and this is a reminder that we are in a spiritual battle. Satan and his forces are at work stealing, spoiling and destroying. 

**Discipleship is about the seeds.**
