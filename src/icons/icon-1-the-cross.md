description: It is at the cross that our journey of discipleship must begin, and
  it is to the cross that we must continually return.
passages:
  - reference: Romans 5:8
    text: "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still
      sinners, Christ died for us."
  - reference: Luke 9:23
    text: "Then he said to them all: ‘Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny
      themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me."
  - text: The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found
      it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and
      bought that field.
    reference: Matt 13.44
  - reference: Phil 3.7-12
    text: But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.
      What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth
      of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I
      consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not
      having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which
      is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the
      basis of faith. I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his
      resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his
      death, and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead. Not
      that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal,
      but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of
      me.
  - reference: 1 Peter 2.24
    text: He himself bore our sins, in his body on the cross, so that we might die
      to sins and live for righteousness
  - reference: Col 3:17
    text: And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the
      Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
  - reference: Revelation 5.12
    text: Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom
      and might and honour and glory and blessing!
practices:
  - Repentance and faith
  - Baptism and the sign of the cross
  - Worship and thanks
  - Daily surrender and trust
questions:
  - "Do I know that I‘m deeply, truly loved by God? "
  - Am I “always giving thanks to the Father” through Jesus Christ?
  - What do I need to give up to follow Jesus?
  - What do I need to take hold of?

Jesus is the heart of discipleship.

God with us - loving, teaching, demonstrating and calling us into His Kingdom.

The cross is an end and a beginning.

The end of sin for us - its power is broken. The end of shame - it is washed away. It is death’s end - our death Jesus died. And it is the end of Satan’s rule - he has no right to control us.

It’s also a beginning, the doorway to resurrection and the ascension of our King Jesus.

To follow Christ is the death of our old life and the beginning of something new. We let go of what we used to cling to and take hold of the new Kingdom life that is gifted to us.

It is a life of love, a life of freedom but also a life of wonderful obedience and transformation.

**Discipleship is about the cross.**
