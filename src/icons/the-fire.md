questions:
  - The scriptures teach us that we are to keep on being filled with the Holy
    Spirit (Ephesians 5.18) - are you regularly asking for the Holy Spirit to
    fill you? Why not ask now? And remember to give Him time and space - don’t
    rush!
  - Is there an area of your life where you need to ask for the Holy Spirit to
    help you? Do you need healing?
  - Learning to listen for the guidance of the Spirit and obediently following
    takes practice - how are you learning to listen and follow? You may want to
    ask someone else to join you in learning to listen and follow His prompts.
  - Are you creating space for silence and solitude in which to hear the Lord?
    Are their other habits/practices/spiritual disciplines you could take up to
    help you be more sensitive to His presence in your life?
  - Is there an area of your life where you know that you are being disobedient
    or you feel defeated? Down through the years Christians have often practiced
    a daily ‘examen’ where they invite the Holy Spirit to reflect upon the day
    with them and show them what they need to address. (you will find an example
    of an examen in the worksheets at the end of this booklet)
  - "Are you growing in holiness - does your character look more and more like
    Jesus? "
  - Is there anything that you need to confess and seek God’s forgiveness over?
  - Are you aware of the spiritual gifts that the Holy Spirit has given you -
    and are there new gifts you would like? How could you make use of this gift
    in your local Church or Connect group?
  - The Holy Spirit helps us to pray and intercede for others - how are you
    regularly praying and interceding?
  - The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
    faithfulness, gentleness and self-control - which of these fruit do you need
    more of?
  - "  Being filled with the Holy Spirit means that we surrender ourselves into
    God’s hand and leading - is fear and anxiety holding you back? Are you
    trying to grasp or control things?"
  - How are you going to practice the fire?

Fire is a potent symbol of the Holy Spirit - used both in the Bible and throughout Church history.

 It reminds us that as followers of Jesus we need the company, guidance and power of the Holy Spirit within us at all times.

 As followers of Jesus we receive the Spirit into our hearts, like a fire that burns within. 

 His presence is our guiding light - as we listen. 

 His presence is a constant ‘warming’ reminder of whose we are - as we are affirmed as children of God.

 He is a refiner - giving us an awareness of our sin and calling us towards a life that is Christ-like.

 Without the Holy Spirit we lack the power we need to follow.  

 But the Holy Spirit equips us in other ways. He gives to each one of us gifts that we ‘fan into flame’ as we use them for the Kingdom. 

 Through the Spirit we find a different quality of life, filled with the fruits God causes to grow in us. 

 Following Jesus is life ‘in the Spirit’.

 **Discipleship is about the fire.**

 But what do you see as you look at this image? 

 As you talk with Jesus what is He teaching you? 

 Are there particular Bible verses that you find helpful in the light of this image, or is there a part of the scriptures that further illuminates this icon?
