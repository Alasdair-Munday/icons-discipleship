Fire is a potent symbol of the Holy Spirit - used both in the Bible and throughout Church history.

 It reminds us that as followers of Jesus we need the company, guidance and power of the Holy Spirit within us at all times.

 As followers of Jesus we receive the Spirit into our hearts, like a fire that burns within. 

 His presence is our guiding light - as we listen. 

 His presence is a constant ‘warming’ reminder of whose we are - as we are affirmed as children of God.

 He is a refiner - giving us an awareness of our sin and calling us towards a life that is Christ-like.

 Without the Holy Spirit we lack the power we need to follow.  

 But the Holy Spirit equips us in other ways. He gives to each one of us gifts that we ‘fan into flame’ as we use them for the Kingdom. 

 Through the Spirit we find a different quality of life, filled with the fruits God causes to grow in us. 

 Following Jesus is life ‘in the Spirit’.

 **Discipleship is about the fire.**
