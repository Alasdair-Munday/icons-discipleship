Here we have one of the  most powerful images that Jesus left us with.

 Jesus is the vine. 

 Our Father in Heaven the gardener.

 We are the branches. 

 The vine  is about our connection with God and the life-changing teaching of Jesus that we are to marinade in and live out. 

 It is a call to a fruitful life that is marked by obedience to God’s word - the Bible.

 The vine symbolises important Kingdom rhythms of rest, growth and pruning. We are called to cultivate Jesus shaped patterns for living.

 The vine speaks to us about the activity of God in our lives - as a branch from the vine we need to detach from things which keep us from God (even good things that perhaps need a rest) and we engage with what feeds us, restores us and reminds us who we are.

 But the vine reminds us of the ebb and flow of life itself - the many seasons that we will walk through. It promises us God’s life giving presence throughout -  especially in times of suffering.

 **Discipleship is about the vine.**

 But what do you see as you look at this image? 

 As you talk with Jesus what is He teaching you? 

 Are there particular Bible verses that you find helpful in the light of this image, or is there a part of the scriptures that further illuminates this icon?
