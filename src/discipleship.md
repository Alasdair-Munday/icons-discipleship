title: What is a Disciple?
---
A disciple or ‘apprentice’  of “Jesus is \[someone who is] learning from him how to lead their life as he would lead their life if he were they.” Dallas Willard

The call is to relationship with Him. 

It is a friendship that changes every part of our lives.

And it is a call to partner with Him in everyday life. 

Discipleship is relational, it is transformational but it is also about our involvement in God’s Kingdom revolution.
